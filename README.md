# Salutator
A christmas text to speech (TTS) program that will let you pick between available system voices and reproduce a sounding greeting card for these holidays.

# Build
Since its a console application it should be a piece of cake to execute it

Build it with Visual Studio >= 2022 or using dotnet CLI command (TTS is only available on Windows so be careful when building on other platforms)
